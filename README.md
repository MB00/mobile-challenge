Hello there!

This app will not work unless you add your local IP address to the base URL, here:
[RestClientProvider](logic/src/main/java/com/example/logic/base/RestClientProvider.kt)

The `api` folder was not copied over from the original challenge repository, 
so commands for starting up a local server should be executed from there.
